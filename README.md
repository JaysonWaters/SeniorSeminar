# The goal of our project is to make a responsive website using HTML5 and CSS. Advertising N-95 mask (possibly with links to places to buy the mask) to help spead the word.

We used Live Server  v5.7.9 on Visual Studio Code to demo the resposive website for the project without having to purchase a domain
